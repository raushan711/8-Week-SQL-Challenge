Case Study 4
------------
1. How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT node_id) as Unique_node_count FROM data_bank.customer_nodes;

unique_node_count
5


2. What is the number of nodes per region?

SELECT region_id,COUNT(node_id) as node_per_region FROM data_bank.customer_nodes GROUP BY 1;


region_id	node_per_region
1	5
2	5
3	5
4	5
5	5

3. How many customers are allocated to each region?

SELECT region_id,COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as customer_per_region FROM data_bank.customer_nodes GROUP BY 1;


region_id	customer_per_region
1	110
2	105
3	102
4	95
5	88

4. How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?

SELECT ROUND(AVG(end_date-start_date),2) FROM data_bank.customer_nodes WHERE end_date!='9999-12-31'

round
14.63

OR 

SELECT ROUND(AVG(end_date-start_date),2) FROM data_bank.customer_nodes

round
416373.41

5.What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?

a) Median
SELECT region_id,PERCENTILE_CONT(0.50) WITHIN GROUP(order by end_date-start_date) FROM data_bank.customer_nodes WHERE end_date!='9999-12-31'
GROUP BY 1

region_id	percentile_cont
1	15
2	15
3	15
4	15
5	15

b) 80th Percentile

SELECT region_id,PERCENTILE_CONT(0.80) WITHIN GROUP(order by end_date-start_date) FROM data_bank.customer_nodes WHERE end_date!='9999-12-31'
GROUP BY 1

region_id	percentile_cont
1	23
2	23
3	24
4	23
5	24

c) 95th Percentile

region_id	percentile_cont
1	28
2	28
3	28
4	28
5	28
