Customer Transactions


1. What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?
SELECT txn_type,
COUNT(distinct customer_id),
SUM(txn_amount)
FROM data_bank.customer_transactions 
GROUP BY 1


txn_type	count	sum
deposit		500	1359168
purchase	448	806537
withdrawal	439	793003


2. What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?

WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT customer_id,
COUNT(*) as total_count,
SUM(txn_amount) as total_amount
FROM data_bank.customer_transactions 
WHERE txn_type='deposit'
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT customer_id,total_count,(total_amount/total_count) as average FROM CTE 

3.For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?

WITH CTE AS(
SELECT customer_id,EXTRACT(MONTH FROM txn_date) as month,
COUNT(CASE WHEN txn_type='deposit' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) as deposits_cnt, 
COUNT(CASE WHEN txn_type='purchase' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) as purchase_cnt,

GROUP BY 1,2
order by 1)
SELECT month,count(*) FROM CTE WHERE deposits_cnt > 1 AND (purchase_cnt =1 or 
withdrawal_cnt =1) GROUP BY 1





4. What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month?
WITH CTE AS(
SELECT customer_id,to_char(txn_date,'Month') as month,
SUM(CASE 
    WHEN txn_type='deposit' THEN txn_amount 
    WHEN txn_type='purchase' THEN -txn_amount 
    WHEN txn_type='withdrawal' THEN -txn_amount END) as total_balance
FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
GROUP BY 1,2
order by 1,2
)
SELECT *,SUM(total_balance) OVER(partition by customer_id order by month  ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as closing_balance FROM CTE 


-- What is the percentage of customers who increase their closing balance by more than 5%?

WITH total_balance_cte AS(
SELECT customer_id,EXTRACT(Month FROM txn_date) as month,
SUM(CASE 
    WHEN txn_type='deposit' THEN txn_amount 
    WHEN txn_type='purchase' THEN -txn_amount 
    WHEN txn_type='withdrawal' THEN -txn_amount END) as total_balance
FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
GROUP BY 1,2
order by 1,2
),
sum_balance AS 
(
  SELECT *,SUM(total_balance) OVER(partition by customer_id order by month  ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as closing_balance FROM total_balance_cte
),
percentage_calc AS
(
  SELECT *,
 ROUND((closing_balance-(lag(closing_balance) OVER (partition by customer_id order by month)*100.0)) /closing_balance,2)
  as perc 
  FROM sum_balance 
  WHERE closing_balance<>0
)
SELECT 
	ROUND((count(*)*100.0)/(SELECT count(distinct customer_id) FROM data_bank.customer_transactions),2)
    FROM percentage_calc 
WHERE perc>5
